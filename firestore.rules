/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Poli Fit Tracker
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their profile, workouts, and associated photos. Only the authenticated user can read or write their own data.
 * @data_structure The data is structured hierarchically under `/users/{userId}`, with workout sessions stored in a `workouts` subcollection and photo verifications in a `photos` subcollection under each workout.
 * @key_security_decisions User listing is explicitly denied. All data is private to the user, and no shared access is permitted in this version.
 * @denormalization This ruleset uses path-based authorization, so it denormalizes critical authorization data (userId, workoutId) onto the documents themselves, avoiding expensive `get()` operations in the security rules.
